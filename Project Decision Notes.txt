Project decision notes

separated into 2 projects

-> allows me to define as class library
-> then publish as .nuget package

-> allows .net client to consume the .nuegt package rather than remodelling the API

-> beneficial for versioning of the API (new version = new nuget pkg, client need to only consume new pkg :))
